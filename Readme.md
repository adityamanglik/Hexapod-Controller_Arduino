This is the source code for an Arduino project I did with my friend during December 2015. It controls a hexapod utilizing 18 Servo motors(3(Hip, Pelvis, Feet) for each of six legs). Features include 3+3 Gait, moving specified motor to a specified angle, testing all motors and joints for working condition, resetting all motors to a stable position etc.
A youtube video for the entire project, including MATLAB simulation and hexapod parts:
